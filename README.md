Developed a backend system for a food menu using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. 
The project includes the creation of classes for managing food items, menu categories, and user orders. 
Key functionalities include adding food items to the menu, displaying the menu by category, and allowing users to place orders while calculating the total cost. 
The program demonstrates the use of classes, objects, methods, and basic data handling with Python to simulate a real-world restaurant ordering system.
